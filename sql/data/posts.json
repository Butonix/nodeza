Being a new technology, it has been very hard to find companies or developers who also use Node.js in South Africa.\n\nNodeZA, pronounced as Node Z A, is a platform that aims to make it easy to find information about Node.js, learn, share, and connect with other Node users in South Africa.\n\nThe long term goal is to become an information repository for all Node.js related content in South Africa.",
