# NodeZA
> A Node.js information portal and social platform for developers in South Africa.

Node.js is an exciting new technology that is changing the programming landscape. Being a new technology, it has been very hard to find companies or developers who also use Node.js in South Africa.

NodeZA, pronounced as Node Z A, is a platform that aims to make it easy to find information about Node.js, learn, share, and connect with other Node users in South Africa.
The long term goal is to become an information repository for all things that are related to Node.js in South Africa.

NodeZA is built using [WidGet CMS](https://github.com/NodeZA/widget-cms) - a highly modular Node.js framework for building database driven web applications.
